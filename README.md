# Zillow Home Analysis

This project contains our collective analysis on the Housing Market using Zillow’s database on the following parameters: 

-	For Sale Listings per month
- Zillow Observed Rental Index (ZORI)
-	Zillow Home values index (ZHVI)
-	Median list price values
- Home Construction

These csv files will be our scope of analysis, ranging from the years 2018-2023 so that we may be able to see possible trends pre-COVID and post-COVID. The states we analyzed are California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania. Why we chose these specific states was because they were the top 5 in SizeRank, which refers to the population in the state’s entirety.

The schema included in this repository is for the database relating the ZHVI and ZORI databseses together compressed into per state and per month. 

The researchers looked up possible factors that created these trends and here are the links to the research:
